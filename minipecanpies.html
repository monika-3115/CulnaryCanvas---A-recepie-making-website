      <h1 style="font-size: 46px;text-align: center;">Mini Pecan Pies</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">These mini pecan pies are one of my favourite recipies. Made with my favorite homemade pie crust and a salted pecan filling, they’re always a welcome salty-sweet addition to any holiday dessert spread.Pecan pie is a quintessential Thanksgiving pie. Though nothing will ever beat classic apple pie or creamy pumpkin pie in my mind, traditional pecan pie holds a very special place in my heart. </p>

    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>The texture of mini pecan pies is typically a combination of crunchy and gooey. The pecans on top provide a satisfying crunch, while the filling underneath, usually made with ingredients like brown sugar, corn syrup, and eggs, creates a soft and slightly gooey center. The crust adds another layer of texture, usually flaky and buttery.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>Mini pecan pies boast a rich, nutty flavor with caramel undertones. The combination of pecans, brown sugar, and butter creates a sweet, indulgent taste that's balanced by the slight bitterness of the pecans. Additionally, the use of ingredients like vanilla extract and a pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor profile, adding depth to the sweetness.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>Mini pecan pies are relatively easy to prepare, especially if you use pre-made pie crusts. The filling typically involves mixing together ingredients like chopped pecans, brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, butter, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Once the filling is prepared, it's spooned into mini pie crusts and topped with additional pecan halves for decoration.
        The most time-consuming part of the process is often preparing the pie crusts if you're making them from scratch. However, using store-bought crusts can significantly reduce prep time.
        Overall, mini pecan pies require minimal equipment and can be baked in a muffin tin, making them a convenient dessert option for various occasions.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time required to make mini pecan pies can vary depending on whether you're making the pie crust from scratch or using store-bought crusts. Overall, you can expect to spend around 1.5 to 2 hours from start to finish, including prep, baking, and cooling time.

<div class="wrap"><br><br><br><br>
  <div class="wrap-text">
    1.In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.
    Add the cold cubed butter to the flour mixture.
    Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, blend the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
    <br><br>
    2.Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together.
    Shape the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place a rack in the middle position.
    <br><br>
    3.In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped pecans, brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, melted butter, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until well combined.
    Roll out the chilled pie dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness.
    Use a round cookie cutter or glass slightly larger than the mini pie tins to cut out circles of dough.
    <br><br>
    4.Press each dough circle into the mini pie tins, making sure to cover the bottom and sides.
    Spoon the pecan filling into each mini pie crust, filling them about three-quarters full.
    <br><br>
    5.If desired, decorate the tops of the pies with pecan halves.
    Place the mini pecan pies on a baking sheet and transfer them to the preheated oven.
    <br><br>
    6.Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown.
    Allow the mini pecan pies to cool in the tins for about 10-15 minutes.
    <br><br>
    7.Carefully remove them from the tins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
    Serve the mini pecan pies warm or at room temperature, optionally topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
