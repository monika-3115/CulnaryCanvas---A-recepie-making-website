    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>The texture of a raspberry swirl cake is often moist and tender, with a soft crumb. It can be similar to a classic sponge cake or a butter cake, depending on the recipe.
      The raspberry swirl adds an extra element of texture, creating pockets of tartness and fruitiness throughout the cake.
      Depending on the method of swirling, the raspberry component may create a marbled effect, enhancing the visual appeal of the cake.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>The primary flavor of a raspberry swirl cake is, of course, raspberry. The tartness of the raspberries balances the sweetness of the cake, creating a harmonious flavor profile.
      Depending on the recipe, the cake itself may have a vanilla or almond flavor base, which complements the raspberry swirl beautifully.
      Some recipes may incorporate lemon zest or juice to add brightness to the flavor profile, enhancing the overall freshness of the cake.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time required to make a Raspberry Swirl cake can vary depending on the recipe and preparation method. Generally, it takes around 1 to 1.5 hours from start to finish, including preparation, baking, and cooling time.</p>
