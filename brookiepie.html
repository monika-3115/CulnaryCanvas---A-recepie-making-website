      <h1 style="font-size: 46px;text-align: center;">Brookie Pie</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">These mini pecan pies are one of my favourite recipies. Made with my favorite homemade pie crust and a salted pecan filling, they’re always a welcome salty-sweet addition to any holiday dessert spread.Pecan pie is a quintessential Thanksgiving pie. Though nothing will ever beat classic apple pie or creamy pumpkin pie in my mind, traditional pecan pie holds a very special place in my heart. </p>

    <div class="details">
    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>The texture of Brookie Pie is a harmonious blend of chewy, fudgy brownie and soft, slightly crispy cookie. The brownie layer typically forms a dense, moist base, while the cookie layer adds a bit of crunch and crumble on top.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>The flavor profile of Brookie Pie is rich, chocolatey, and indulgent. The brownie layer brings deep cocoa flavors with hints of sweetness, while the cookie layer adds a buttery, vanilla-tinged contrast. Depending on personal preference, you can customize the flavors with additions like nuts, chocolate chips, or even a swirl of caramel.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>Brookie Pie can be relatively easy to prepare, especially if you opt for using pre-made brownie and cookie dough. However, for a homemade touch, you can make both the brownie and cookie layers from scratch. The process typically involves preparing the brownie batter and spreading it evenly in a pie dish, then topping it with spoonfuls of cookie dough before baking. Overall, it's a straightforward dessert to assemble, especially if you're familiar with baking brownies and cookies.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time required to make Brookie Pie will depend on whether you're using pre-made dough or making everything from scratch. If using pre-made dough, assembly can take around 10-15 minutes, and baking usually takes around 30-40 minutes, depending on your oven and the thickness of the layers. For homemade dough, you'll need to allocate additional time for mixing and chilling the dough, which can extend the preparation time to about 1-2 hours, including baking.</p>

    1.Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray or butter.
    In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave.
    <br><br>
    2.Stir in the granulated sugar until well combined.
    Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.
    <br><br>
    3.Stir in the cocoa powder, flour, and salt until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
    In a separate mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
    <br><br>
    4.Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well incorporated.
    In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips if using.
    <br><br>
    5.Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pie dish.
    Drop spoonfuls of the cookie dough over the brownie batter, spreading them out to cover the surface.
    <br><br>
    6.Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is just slightly gooey.
    Remove from the oven and allow the Brookie Pie to cool in the pie dish for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving.
    <br><br>
    7.Slice the Brookie Pie into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. Enjoy with a scoop of ice cream or whipped cream if desired.
