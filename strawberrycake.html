      <p style="text-align: left;"> The one thing that sets this strawberry cake apart from others? Reduce fresh strawberry puree down and add to the best white cake batter.This strawberry cake completely blew me away. After years of mediocre from-scratch strawberry cakes, my expectations were pretty low. It was time to taste test my efforts. Biting into the first pastel-pink forkful was the moment of truth… </p>

    <div class="details">
    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>A well-made strawberry cake typically has a light and fluffy texture. The cake layers are soft and moist, with a delicate crumb that melts in your mouth.The texture can vary depending on the recipe and whether the cake is frosted with whipped cream, buttercream, or cream cheese frosting. A whipped cream frosting will lend a light and airy feel, while buttercream will provide a smoother and more substantial texture</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>The primary flavor of a strawberry cake is, of course, strawberry. Whether using fresh strawberries, strawberry puree, or strawberry extract, the cake is imbued with a sweet and fruity taste that's reminiscent of ripe strawberries.
        To enhance the strawberry flavor, some recipes may also include strawberry jam or preserves, adding depth and intensity to the cake's taste.</p>
   
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>Preparing and baking a strawberry cake typically takes around 1 to 1.5 hours from start to finish, including prep time, baking time, and cooling time.</p>

   1. Preheat Oven and Prepare Pans:
    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper for easy removal. <br>
   2. Prepare Strawberry Puree:
    If using fresh strawberries, hull and chop them. Place the chopped strawberries in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth to make the strawberry puree. Set aside. <br>
   3. Prepare Dry Ingredients:
    In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set aside. <br>
   4. Cream Butter and Sugar:
    In a large mixing bowl, beat together the softened butter and vegetable oil until smooth and creamy.
    Gradually add the granulated sugar and continue beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. <br>
   5. Add Eggs and Vanilla:
    Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until well incorporated.
    Mix in the vanilla extract until combined. <br>
   6. Alternate Adding Dry and Wet Ingredients:
    Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. <br>
   7. Fold in Strawberry Components:
    Gently fold in the chopped strawberries and strawberry puree until evenly distributed throughout the batter. Be careful not to overmix. <br>
  8. Divide Batter and Bake:
    Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.
    Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
    Remove from the oven and allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. <br>
   9. Prepare Frosting (optional):
    While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat together softened butter, confectioners' sugar, strawberry puree, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. <br>
   10. Assemble the Cake:
    Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a layer of frosting evenly over the top.
    Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.
    Optionally, garnish the cake with fresh strawberry slices or whipped cream.
