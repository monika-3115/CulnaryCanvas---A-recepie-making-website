      <p style="text-align: left;">A spicy twist on a twisted classic, these jalapeño cheddar soft pretzels start with my easy homemade pretzel dough. Add a little garlic powder, and load the shaped pretzels with sliced jalapeños and sharp cheddar cheese. Just like with traditional homemade soft pretzels, there’s hardly any rise time, so you can enjoy hot, cheesy jalapeño cheddar pretzels in less than an hour!</p>

    <p>
        Have you ever made my recipe for homemade soft pretzels? It’s become one of the most reader-loved recipes on this website because the pretzels are delicious, relatively quick, and easy enough for bakers who have never worked with yeast before.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        And, I have to admit, today’s version is even better. Oh, the flavor! Of course, if you don’t like spicy, you’ll probably prefer the originals.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I even use the same dough for making soft pretzel knots, soft pretzel bites, and pretzel rolls. The dough is made from the simplest baking ingredients and there’s hardly any rise time, so not only are these easy, they’re pretty quick too. I promise you don’t need to feel intimidated about working with yeast, shaping pretzels, or the baking soda bath—I’ll walk you through all of it.
    </p><br>
    <p>About the original pretzels:</p><br><br>

  <h1>Start With This 7-Ingredient Pretzel Dough</h1><br>
  <p>
    Let’s chat about the soft pretzel dough. You need just a few basic bread-making ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen:
  </p><br>
  <ol style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <li>
            <b>Yeast:</b> I always use Platinum Yeast from Red Star, which is an instant yeast. The Platinum yeast is fantastic because its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple. Your pretzels, your dinner rolls, your breads, your pizza dough—all will puff up more. You only need 1 standard packet of yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons) to get the job done.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <b>Water:</b> Use warm water. No need to take the temperature, but think lukewarm to the touch, about 100°F (38°C).
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <b>Salt:</b> Salt adds necessary flavor. Can’t have tasty pretzels without some salt!
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <b>Garlic Powder:</b> My classic <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="./pretzels.html">soft pretzel recipe</a> doesn’t include garlic powder, but I absolutely LOVE the flavor it adds to these jalapeño cheddar pretzels.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <b>Sugar:</b> 1 Tablespoon of sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough; it also balances out all the saltiness.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <b>Melted Butter:</b> Nothing beats butter for delicious buttery flavor in pretzels!
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <b>Flour:</b> I always use all-purpose flour, but you can substitute bread flour for even chewier pretzels.
        </li><br>
   </ol><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jalapenos-cheddar-cheese-flour-yeast.jpg" width="800px"><br><br>
  <h1>Make the Dough—It’s Easy</h1><br>
  <p>
    Bring the dough together in a large mixing bowl. You can use a stand mixer, or a regular large mixing bowl + a wooden spoon or silicone spatula. Knead it on the counter (or continue using your mixer), and then let the dough rest for about 10 minutes. If you are new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    You know the best part about making pretzels? That’s the only rest/rise time for the dough. Just 10 minutes—a little power nap—while you get the baking soda + water boiling on the stove.
  </p><br><br>
  <hr><br><br>
  <h1>Don’t Skip the Baking Soda Bath</h1>
  <p>
    While it sounds strange, this step is what gives pretzels their iconic flavor and chewy texture; plus, it helps deepen their golden-brown color in the oven, and locks in the super soft interior. The boiling water also helps set their shape so the pretzels don’t over-puff in the oven.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Combine 1/2 cup of baking soda with 9 cups of water in a large pot (I use my Dutch oven) and bring it up to a boil. The unbaked pretzels get a quick dip in here before baking. (A little rest followed by a hot bath—these pretzels have it GOOD.)
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Without the baking soda bath, you lose texture, that deep brown color, and flavor. So basically, you will have bread instead of pretzels. Nothing wrong with bread! But it’s not on the menu today.
  </p><br><br>
  <hr><br><br>
  <h1>How to Shape Pretzels</h1>
  <p>
    While you’re waiting for the water to boil, it’s time to shape the pretzels.
  </p><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pretzel-yeasted-dough.jpg" width="800px"><br>
  <p>
    Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Each will be about 1/3 cup in size, or 75g.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Roll each into a 20–22-inch-long rope:
  </p><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hands-rolling-rope-of-dough.jpg" width="800px"><br>
  <p>
    Twist the ends and bring the ends down, and lightly press the dough together. That’s a pretzel!
  </p><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pretzel-yeasted-dough-2.jpg" width="800px"><br>
  <p>
    Place the shaped pretzels onto baking sheets lined with silicone mats or greased parchment paper. This pretzel dough makes 12 regular-size soft pretzels, so I use 2 baking sheets, 6 pretzels on each.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Once the pretzels are all shaped and the water is boiling, it’s baking soda bath time! Carefully drop the pretzels, a couple at a time, into the boiling water + baking soda. Let them boil for 20–30 seconds each (no longer than that, or they’ll have a metallic taste), then use a slotted spatula to remove them, let the excess water drip off, and place the boiled pretzels back onto the lined baking sheets.
  </p><br><br>
  <hr><br><br>
  <h1>Topping Jalapeño Cheddar Soft Pretzels</h1><br>
  <p>
    Brush the boiled pretzels with melted butter and place a few jalapeño pepper slices on each, lightly pressing down to get them to stick, then sprinkle the pretzels with coarse salt. Now they’re ready to bake! You’ll add the cheese next…
  </p><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/adding-jalapenos-cheese-to-pretzels.jpg" width="800px"><br><br>
  <p>
    About halfway through baking, take the pretzels out and top them with shredded cheddar cheese, then return them to the oven for the remaining bake time. The cheese gets nice and melty and a little crispy around the pretzel edges—so yum.
  </p><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/adding-jalapenos-cheese-to-pretzels-2.jpg" width="800px"><br>
  <p>
    And if you really want to lean into spicy cheese with this recipe, you can serve these pretzels with this spicy nacho cheese sauce for dipping. I like serving them with stone-ground mustard.
  </p><br>
  <img  style="margin-left: 11%;" src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jalapeno-and-cheddar-soft-pretzels.jpg" width="800px"><br>
  <p>
    Not a chance these pretzels will make it to halftime. If you like heat, serve the pretzels with a big bowl of spicy honey Chex mix. Both are excellent weekend/game day snacks!

    <h1>Instructions</h1><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the yeast into the warm water. Cover and allow to sit for 1 minute.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Whisk in salt, garlic powder, sugar, and melted butter. Add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup (125g) at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, or use a dough hook attachment, until combined. Add 3/4 cup more flour and mix for 1 minute. If the dough is still sticky, add 1/4–1/2 cup more, as needed.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
           <b>Knead the dough:</b>Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Shape the dough into a ball. Cover lightly with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes, or cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 1 day. To freeze, see freezing instructions in recipe Notes. (Meanwhile, I like to get the water + baking soda boiling as instructed in step 7.)
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line 2 baking sheets with greased parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Silicone baking mats are highly recommended over parchment paper. Set aside.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Drop 1 or 2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20–30 seconds. Any longer than that and your pretzels will have a metallic taste. Using a slotted spatula, lift the pretzel out of the water and allow excess water to drip off. Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet. Brush with melted butter. Place several jalapeño slices on each, pressing down lightly to get them to stick. Sprinkle each with coarse salt. Repeat with remaining pretzels. If desired, you can cover and refrigerate the boiled/unbaked pretzels for up to 24 hours before baking in step 9.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Bake for 10 minutes, remove pretzels from the oven, and sprinkle 2–3 Tablespoons of shredded cheese on top of each. Return to the oven for 8–12 more minutes, until the pretzels are golden brown and the cheese is melted.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and serve warm.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            Cover and store leftover pretzels at room temperature for up to 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. They lose a little softness over time. To reheat, microwave for a few seconds, or bake at 350°F (177°C) for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <br><br><br><br>
