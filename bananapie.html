      <h1 style="font-size: 46px;text-align: center;">Banana Cream Pie</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Creamy and smooth from-scratch custard joins bananas, whipped cream, and a buttery flaky baked pie crust to make one epic banana cream pie. This classic dessert is 100% homemade, like my cherry pie, and the perfect make-ahead option because the layered beauty needs to set before garnishing and serving.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 44px;">Coconut Cream Pie</h1>
    <div class="details">
    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>The texture of coconut cream pie is lusciously creamy. The filling is smooth and velvety, thanks to the combination of coconut milk or cream, eggs, and cornstarch or flour used as thickeners. The addition of shredded coconut can introduce a slight chewiness or crunch, depending on how finely it's shredded and whether it's toasted before being incorporated into the filling.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>The dominant flavor in coconut cream pie is, of course, coconut. The filling is typically made with coconut milk or cream, giving it a robust coconut taste. Additionally, sugar and vanilla extract are often added to enhance the sweetness and flavor profile. Some recipes may also include shredded coconut for added texture and intensity of coconut flavor.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>While making a coconut cream pie from scratch may seem daunting, it's actually quite manageable, especially if you use a pre-made pie crust. The filling typically involves cooking a custard-like mixture on the stovetop, which requires some attention to prevent scorching or curdling. However, as long as you follow the recipe instructions closely and stir continuously, it's not overly complicated.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time required to make coconut cream pie can vary depending on whether you're making the pie crust from scratch or using a pre-made one, as well as the specific recipe you're following. However, as a general estimate, you can expect the preparation and cooking time to be around 1 to 1.5 hours. Additionally, the pie needs to chill in the refrigerator for several hours, preferably overnight, to set properly before slicing and serving.

  <div class="wrap-text">
    1.You can use a store-bought pie crust or make one from scratch. For a homemade crust, combine all-purpose flour, cold butter, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a food processor.
    Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add a few tablespoons of ice water and pulse until the dough comes together.
    <br><br>
    2.Shape the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
    While the dough chills, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
    <br><br>
    3.Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface to fit a pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and up the sides.
    Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork.
    <br><br>
    4.Line the crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans to prevent it from puffing up.
    Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, then remove the weights and parchment paper and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.
    <br><br>
    5.In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, whole milk, sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt.
    Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a simmer. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes.
    Remove the mixture from heat and stir in shredded coconut, butter, and vanilla extract until the butter is melted and the filling is smooth.
    <br><br>
    6.Pour the coconut filling into the cooled pie crust, spreading it evenly.
    Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling to prevent a skin from forming.
    <br><br>
    7.Let the pie cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.
    Before serving, whip heavy cream with sugar and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
    Spread the whipped cream over the chilled pie, covering the coconut filling completely.
