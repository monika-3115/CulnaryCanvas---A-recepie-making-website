      <p style="text-align: left;">This creamy and indulgent French silk pie combines my best flaky pie crust, smooth-as-silk chocolate filling, and fresh whipped cream on top. This recipe uses cooked eggs, so you don’t have to worry about consuming raw eggs.</p>

    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>French silk pie has a velvety smooth texture that melts in your mouth. The filling is typically made by whipping together butter, sugar, eggs, and melted chocolate until it's light and airy. This creates a creamy consistency that contrasts beautifully with the flaky pie crust.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p> The flavor of French silk pie is dominated by rich chocolate, thanks to the generous amount of melted chocolate used in the filling. It's sweet but not overly so, with a hint of butteriness from the whipped butter. Some recipes also incorporate a touch of vanilla extract to enhance the overall flavor profile. When served chilled, the flavors are intensified, making each bite a delightfully indulgent experience.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>French silk pie is relatively straightforward to make, but it does require some patience and attention to detail, especially when it comes to whipping the filling to the right consistency and ensuring that all the ingredients are well incorporated. Beginners might find it a bit challenging, but with practice, it becomes easier.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>While French silk pie doesn't require extensive baking time, it does involve several steps to achieve the perfect texture and flavor. You'll need to prepare the pie crust, bake it until golden brown, and then make the filling, which usually requires some chilling time to set properly. Overall, you can expect to spend about 30-45 minutes of active preparation time, plus additional time for chilling.</p>

    1.Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
    In a bowl, mix together the chocolate cookie crumbs and melted butter until well combined.
    Press the mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish. <br><br>
    2.Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let it cool completely.
    In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. <br><br>
    3.Gradually add the melted chocolate and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture, beating until smooth and well combined.
    Add the eggs, one at a time, beating on medium speed for 3 minutes after each addition. The filling should be silky smooth and well aerated. <br><br>
    4.Once all the eggs are incorporated, continue beating the mixture on high speed for an additional 5 minutes until it becomes light and fluffy, resembling a mousse-like texture.
    Pour the French silk filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. <br><br>
   5.Cover the pie with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is firm and set.
    Before serving, top the pie with whipped cream and garnish with chocolate shavings or a dusting of cocoa powder, if desired. <br><br>
    6.Slice and serve chilled, enjoying the rich and creamy texture of the French silk filling with each decadent bite.
