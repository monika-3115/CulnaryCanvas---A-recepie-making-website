      <p style="text-align: left;"> With its outstanding spice flavor, super moist crumb, and velvety cream cheese frosting, this is truly the best carrot cake. Use brown sugar and toasted pecans for deeper flavor I don’t call it carrot cake. I call it “birthday cake.” It’s my one and only choice on my big day. I’ve adopted this tradition and make my own carrot birthday cake each year. And, of course, we never limit it to only once per year. This is always my top choice for Easter dessert recipes and I love making it for spring brunches, baby showers, and our community’s new bake sale. </p>

    <div class="details">
    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p> Red velvet cake typically has a moist and tender crumb. It's not as dense as a traditional chocolate cake but is still firm enough to hold up well to frosting. The texture is often described as velvety, hence the name. When properly baked, red velvet cake should be soft, with a delicate crumb that melts in your mouth.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>Red velvet cake has a unique flavor profile that's both mildly chocolaty and slightly tangy with a hint of vanilla. The cocoa powder used in the recipe provides a subtle chocolate flavor, while buttermilk and vinegar add a tangy undertone. The combination of these flavors creates a balanced and slightly complex taste that sets red velvet cake apart from other cakes.</p>
   
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time required to make red velvet cake can vary depending on the recipe and whether you're making it from scratch or using a cake mix. Generally, preparing the batter takes about 15-20 minutes, and baking typically takes around 25-30 minutes for two 9-inch round cake layers. Cooling the cake layers and frosting the cake will add additional time. In total, you can expect to spend about 1 to 1.5 hours from start to finish.</p>

 1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. <br><br>
2. Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. <br>
3. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. <br><br>
4. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick. <br><br>
5. Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling. <br><br>
6. Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny. <br><br>
7. Assemble and frost: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. I used Wilton piping tip #12 for decoration around the top. <br><br>
8. Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting. <br>
9. Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving. <br><br><br>
