    <div class="details">
    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p> A homemade buttery flaky pie crust is characterized by its tender, flaky texture. When baked, it should have layers that are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The buttery flavor adds richness and depth to the crust, while the flakiness provides a satisfying mouthfeel with each bite.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>Making a homemade pie crust does require a bit of time, but the process itself is relatively straightforward. You'll need to allow time for chilling the dough, which helps relax the gluten and prevents the crust from shrinking during baking. In total, you can expect the preparation time to be around 15-20 minutes, plus additional chilling time of at least 1 hour.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>While making pie crust from scratch might seem daunting to some, it's actually quite simple, especially with practice. The key is to handle the dough gently and avoid overworking it, as this can result in a tough crust. With a few basic ingredients and some patience, you can achieve a delicious homemade pie crust that's far superior to store-bought options.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p> The flavor of a homemade buttery flaky pie crust is unbeatable. It's made with just a few simple ingredients, including flour, butter, salt, and water, allowing the buttery flavor to shine through. The combination of butter and flour creates a rich, savory taste that pairs perfectly with sweet or savory fillings.</p>

  <div class="wrap-text">
    1.In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt until well combined.
    Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingertips, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.
    <br><br>
    2.Gradually add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing the mixture with a fork or your hands until the dough begins to come together. Be careful not to add too much water; you want the dough to be just moist enough to hold together when squeezed.
    Turn the dough out onto a clean, floured surface. Gently gather the dough into a ball and divide it in half. Flatten each half into a disc, wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. Chilling the dough allows the gluten to relax and helps prevent shrinkage during baking.
    <br><br>
    3.Remove one disc of dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to slightly soften.
    On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter, depending on the size of your pie dish. Roll from the center outward, rotating the dough occasionally to maintain an even thickness. Aim for about 1/8 inch thickness.
    <br><br>
    4.Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9-inch pie dish. Gently press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the dish, being careful not to stretch it. Trim any excess dough from the edges, leaving about a 1-inch overhang.
    <br><br>
    5.If making a single-crust pie, flute the edges or crimp them with a fork for a decorative finish. If making a double-crust pie, add your filling to the bottom crust, then roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal the pie.
    <br><br>
    6.Follow the baking instructions for your specific pie recipe. For pre-baked crusts (blind baking), prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, line it with parchment paper or foil, fill it with pie weights or dried beans, and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 15-20 minutes until lightly golden. Remove the weights and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes until fully baked and golden brown.
