      <h1 style="font-size: 46px;text-align: center;">Spiced Pumpkin Tart</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">This pumpkin tart combines a pecan pastry crust and simple pumpkin pie filling. Though the 9-inch tart has 8 servings similar to traditional pumpkin pie, the slices are thinner so the tart bakes and cools quicker. If you crave flavorful pumpkin treats, you’ll enjoy this generously spiced filling with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and a touch a black pepper for bold robust flavor.</p>

    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>Smooth and creamy filling with a velvety texture, thanks to the pureed pumpkin and cream.
        The crust should be firm enough to hold the filling but still tender and crumbly.
        The spices add a subtle graininess, which enhances the overall texture and mouthfeel.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>Rich pumpkin flavor with warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.
        Depending on personal preference, you can adjust the level of sweetness to balance the spices and pumpkin flavor.
        The crust adds a buttery, slightly sweet undertone to complement the spiced pumpkin filling.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>While making a spiced pumpkin tart involves several steps, it's not overly complicated and is suitable for intermediate-level bakers.
        Key steps include making the crust, preparing the pumpkin filling, and baking the tart until set.
        Preparing the pumpkin filling involves mixing ingredients like pumpkin puree, eggs, sugar, spices, and cream until smooth and well combined.
        The crust can be made from scratch using flour, butter, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Alternatively, you can use store-bought pie crust for convenience.
        The tart requires some chilling and baking time, but the hands-on preparation is relatively straightforward.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>Prep Time: 30-40 minutes (including crust preparation and filling mixing) <br>
        Chilling Time (for the crust): 30 minutes to 1 hour <br>
        Baking Time: 45-55 minutes (at around 375°F or 190°C) <br>
        Cooling Time: 1-2 hours (to allow the tart to set completely)

1.Begin by making the crust. You can either use a homemade crust or a store-bought one for convenience.
If making the crust from scratch, combine flour, cold butter, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
<br><br>
2.Add a few tablespoons of cold water and pulse until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.
Shape the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow it to firm up.
<br><br>
3.While the dough chills, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Once chilled, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a tart pan.
<br><br>
4.Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to the tart pan, pressing it into the bottom and up the sides. Trim any excess dough.
To prevent the crust from becoming soggy, you can blind bake it before adding the filling. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans.
<br><br>
5.Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, then remove the weights and parchment paper and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly.
In a mixing bowl, combine pumpkin puree, eggs, sugar, spices (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger), and heavy cream.
<br><br>
6.Mix until smooth and well combined. Adjust the sweetness and spice levels according to your preference.
Pour the pumpkin filling into the partially baked crust, spreading it evenly.
<br><br>
7.Place the tart in the preheated oven and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the filling is set and slightly puffed. The center should jiggle slightly when gently shaken.
Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 1-2 hours to allow the filling to set completely.
<br><br>
8.Once cooled, slice the spiced pumpkin tart into wedges and serve.
Optionally, garnish with whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon before serving.
