      <h1 style="font-size: 43px;text-align: center;">Carrot Cake</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> With its outstanding spice flavor, super moist crumb, and velvety cream cheese frosting, this is truly the best carrot cake. Use brown sugar and toasted pecans for deeper flavor I don’t call it carrot cake. I call it “birthday cake.” It’s my one and only choice on my big day. I’ve adopted this tradition and make my own carrot birthday cake each year. And, of course, we never limit it to only once per year. This is always my top choice for Easter dessert recipes and I love making it for spring brunches, baby showers, and our community’s new bake sale. </p>

    <div class="details">
    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>A well-made carrot cake has a moist and tender crumb. Grated carrots add moisture to the cake while also providing a slight crunch.
        The texture is often dense but not heavy, with a soft and springy feel to the cake layers.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>The primary flavor of carrot cake is, of course, carrot, but it's complemented by a blend of warm spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and sometimes ginger or cloves.
        Sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners like honey or maple syrup, carrot cake has a delicate sweetness that balances the earthiness of the carrots and the warmth of the spices.</p>
   
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p> Preparing and baking a carrot cake typically takes around 1.5 to 2 hours from start to finish, including prep time, baking time, and cooling time. After baking, the cake layers need to cool completely before frosting, which can take an additional 1 to 2 hours.</p>

    1.Prepare Dry Ingredients:
    In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and any other spices you're using (such as nutmeg and ginger). <br>
   2.Prepare Wet Ingredients:
    In a large mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil or melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined and smooth. <br>
    3.Grate Carrots:
    Peel and grate enough carrots to make 3 cups. Use the fine side of a box grater for a finer texture, or the larger side for a chunkier texture. Set aside. <br>
    4.Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:
    Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a tough cake. <br>
    5.Fold in Carrots and Optional Additions:
    Gently fold the grated carrots into the batter until evenly distributed. If using optional additions like nuts, coconut, or dried fruit, fold them in at this stage as well. <br>
    6.Divide Batter and Bake:
    Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.
    Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
    Remove from the oven and allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. <br>
    7.Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting (Optional):
    While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat together softened cream cheese, softened butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. <br><br><br>
