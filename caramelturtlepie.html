      <h1 style="font-size: 46px;text-align: center;">Caramel Turtle Brownie Pie</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">These mini pecan pies are one of my favourite recipies. Made with my favorite homemade pie crust and a salted pecan filling, they’re always a welcome salty-sweet addition to any holiday dessert spread.Pecan pie is a quintessential Thanksgiving pie. Though nothing will ever beat classic apple pie or creamy pumpkin pie in my mind, traditional pecan pie holds a very special place in my heart. </p>

    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p>The texture of this dessert would likely be rich, indulgent, and decadent. The brownie layer would be dense and fudgy, while the caramel layer would add a gooey and sticky texture. Additionally, any nuts (typically pecans in a turtle dessert) would provide a crunchy contrast to the softness of the brownie and caramel layers.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>The flavor profile of a Caramel Turtle Brownie Pie would be a symphony of sweetness and richness. The brownie layer would offer a deep chocolate flavor with hints of cocoa, while the caramel layer would bring a sweet, buttery, and slightly salty taste. The addition of pecans would contribute a nutty flavor and a pleasant crunch, reminiscent of classic turtle candies.</p>
    <br><h2>Ease:</h2>
    <p>While this dessert sounds fancy, it can be quite simple to prepare, especially if you use pre-made components like store-bought brownie mix or caramel sauce. You would essentially need to prepare or buy a brownie batter, bake it in a pie dish, pour over a layer of caramel sauce (either homemade or store-bought), sprinkle with chopped pecans, and bake until set. It's a straightforward process that doesn't require advanced baking skills.</p>
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time required to make a Caramel Turtle Brownie Pie would depend on whether you're making everything from scratch or utilizing pre-made ingredients. If you're making the brownie batter from scratch, it might take a bit longer. However, if you're using a store-bought brownie mix and caramel sauce, the preparation time would be shorter. In total, you're looking at around 1 to 1.5 hours, including prep time and baking time </p>
