    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p> The texture of a well-made vanilla cake is light, fluffy, and moist, with a fine crumb that melts in your mouth. The cake layers should be tender and airy, providing a satisfying bite that's neither too dense nor too airy.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p> At the heart of a vanilla cake is its signature flavor—fragrant, aromatic vanilla. This quintessential ingredient lends the cake a delicate sweetness and a warm, comforting aroma that's both nostalgic and comforting. The vanilla flavor should be prominent but balanced, complementing other ingredients without overwhelming them.</p>
   
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The time it takes to bake a vanilla cake can vary depending on factors such as the size and type of cake pan, the specific recipe used, and the accuracy of your oven's temperature. However, a typical baking time for a standard-sized vanilla cake is usually around 25 to 35 minutes.</p>

   Preparation:
   <br>
   <br>
   1. Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe (usually around 350°F or 180°C).  <br> <br>
   2. Prepare your cake pans by greasing and flouring them or lining them with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
   <br> <br>
   3. Batter Preparation: Prepare the vanilla cake batter according to your recipe, making sure to mix the ingredients thoroughly until smooth. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.  <br> <br><br>
   4. Baking: Place the cake pans in the preheated oven and bake according to your recipe's instructions. Typically, this will involve baking for around 25 to 35 minutes, but it's essential to check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the cakes. If the toothpick comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs attached, the cakes are done. Avoid overbaking, as this can result in dry cake layers. <br> <br>
   5. Cooling: Once baked, remove the cake pans from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes.
   <br>
   6. Afterward, carefully remove the cakes from the pans and allow them to cool completely on the wire rack before frosting or decorating.<br><br><br>
