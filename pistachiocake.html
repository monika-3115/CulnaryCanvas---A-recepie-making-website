    <br><h2>Texture:</h2>
    <p> The combination of real pistachios + almond extract results in a soft, buttery pistachio cake. Cake flour and egg whites keep the texture light and delicate.</p>
    <br><h2>Flavor:</h2>
    <p>This pistachio cake is made without any artificial flavors. The natural flavors of pistachio, almond, butter, and vanilla really shine through in each bite.</p>
   
    <br><h2>Time:</h2>
    <p>The baking time for a pistachio cake can vary depending on factors such as the size and type of pan used, the specific recipe, and your oven's temperature. However, as a general guideline: <br><br>

       1. Preparation Time: Preparing the batter usually takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on the complexity of the recipe and whether you're using pre-ground pistachios or grinding them yourself. <br> <br>
        2. Baking Time: Baking a pistachio cake typically takes anywhere from 25 to 45 minutes. The exact time will depend on factors like the thickness of the batter, the size of the cake pan, and your oven's temperature accuracy.</p>

   <br>
  1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease three 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. <br><br>
  2. Make the cake: Pulse the pistachios in a food processor until ground up into very fine crumbs. See photo above for a visual. You’ll have about 1 and 1/2 cups of crumbs. (If you have more than that, set aside for garnish.) <br><br>
  3. Pour 1 and 1/2 cups of pistachio crumbs in a large bowl. Whisk in the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.<br><br>
   
 4. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Beat in the sour cream, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, pour in the milk (and the green food coloring, if using) and mix just until combined. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.<br><br>
  5. Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 21-23 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it’s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.<br><br>
   6. Make the frosting: Prepare the cream cheese frosting <br><br>
  7. Assemble and decorate: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and evenly cover the top with more frosting. Top with the third cake layer. Spread the frosting all over the top and sides. (I used a bench scraper to smooth out the sides.) Decorate with garnishes, if desired. Refrigerate for at least 30-45 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake keep its shape when cutting.<br><br>
  8. Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. <br><br><br>
